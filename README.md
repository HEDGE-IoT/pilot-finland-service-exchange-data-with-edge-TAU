### Functional Requirements
- The system should be able to receive data from the data space connector.  
- The system should be able to send data to the data space connector.  
- The system should be able to publish data to the message broker.  
- The system should be able to receive data from the message broker.  
- The system should be able to harmonise the incoming and outgoing data.  
- The system should be able to establish a connection to the data space connector.  

---

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Captured data should be available for processing.  
- Incoming data should be valid.  
- 99.9% uptime for the service.  
- A connection to the data space connector should be available.

### Service Interfaces
The data exchange with edge is performed through the **Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC)**.  
This ensures secure connectivity between cloud and edge systems.  

The service itself does not expose additional interfaces.  
For more information on the EDC, see the documentation:  
[Eclipse EDC Documentation](https://eclipse-edc.github.io/documentation/for-adopters/)
